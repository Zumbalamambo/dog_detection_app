You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `dogapp/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook dog_app.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook dog_app.ipynb
```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.
